# Sign-Flip-Attack
This is the **Pytorch** code of our ECCV2020 paper "Boosting Decision-based Black-box Adversarial Attacks with Random Sign Flip" (SFA).
In this paper, we proposed a simple and efficient decision-based black-box l-inf adversarial attack.

# Usage
We provide an example of how to perform targeted and untargeted attacks with SFA in `test.py`. `original_img.png` and `target_img.png` are randomly selected from ImageNet.
